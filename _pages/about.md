## BIO
Takuya is a postdoctoral research associate at the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/takuya-kurihana). I earned Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Chicago under the amazing mentorship of [Ian Foster](https://www.anl.gov/profile/ian-t-foster) at [Globus labs](https://labs.globus.org/).
During my Ph.D. I focused on developing cutting-edge deep neural networks for remote sensing and climate dataset. 
I received B.S. degree in Meteorology from University of Tsukuba, Japan. See [\[CV\]](https://takglobus.github.io/takuyakurihana.github.io/files/cv_takuya_kurihana_June2024.pdf) for my full academic resume. 

My research interests focus in the area of data science; application of deep learning, machine learning, high performance computing, large-scale data science. 
In particular, I have studied topics in self-supervised / semi-supervised learning, generative models, vision foundation models, and large language models (LLMs), contributing to the innovative intersection of AI and environmental science.
