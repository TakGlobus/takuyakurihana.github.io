## About Takuya __卓弥__
I’m a third year Ph.D student in the [Globus labs](https://labs.globus.org/)  under the supervision of Dr. [Ian Foster](https://www.anl.gov/profile/ian-t-foster), at [The University of Chicago, Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/). I received B.S. and M.S. degrees in Meteorology from University of Tsukuba, Japan and M.S degree in Computer Science from The University of Chicago, USA. See CV for my full resume. 

My research interests focus in the area of data science, including application of deep learning, machine learning, high performance computing, large-scale data science, and cloud physics. In particular, I have studied topics in unsupervised and semi-supervised deep learning applications towards a variety of natural science fields, including meteorology, remote sensing, and bioinformatics.
