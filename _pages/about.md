## BIO
Takuya is a Senior Researcher at [Fujitsu Research America](https://www.fujitsu.com/us/about/businesspolicy/tech/rd/converging-lab/). Before joining Fujitsu, he was a postdoctoral research associate at the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/takuya-kurihana). He earned Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Chicago under the amazing mentorship of [Ian Foster](https://www.anl.gov/profile/ian-t-foster) at [Globus labs](https://labs.globus.org/).
During my Ph.D. I focused on developing cutting-edge deep neural networks for remote sensing and climate dataset. 
He received B.S. degree in Meteorology from University of Tsukuba, Japan. See [\[CV\]](https://takglobus.github.io/takuyakurihana.github.io/files/cv_takuya_kurihana_April2025.pdf) for his full academic resume. 

His research interests focus on the large-scale deep learning; application of deep learning, machine learning, high performance computing, large-scale data science. 
In particular, his resesarch topics cover across self-supervised / semi-supervised learning, generative models, foundation models, and autoregressive model, contributing to the innovative intersection of AI and environmental science.
