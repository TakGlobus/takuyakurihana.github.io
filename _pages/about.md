## BIO
I’m a third year Ph.D student in the [Globus labs](https://labs.globus.org/) advised by Dr. [Ian Foster](https://www.anl.gov/profile/ian-t-foster),
at [The University of Chicago, Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/). 
I received B.S. and M.S. degree in Meteorology from University of Tsukuba, Japan 
and M.S degree in Computer Science from The University of Chicago, USA. See [\[CV\]](https://takglobus.github.io/takuyakurihana.github.io/files/cv_takuya_kurihana_latest.pdf) for my full resume. 

My research interests focus in the area of data science; application of deep learning, machine learning, high performance computing, large-scale data science, and cloud physics. 
In particular, I have studied topics in unsupervised and semi-supervised deep learning applications towards a variety of natural science fields, 
including meteorology, remote sensing, and bioinformatics.
